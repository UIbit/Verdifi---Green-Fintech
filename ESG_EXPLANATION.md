# ESG Financial Modeling - Explanation

## What is ESG?

**ESG** stands for **Environmental, Social, and Governance** - three key factors used to evaluate the sustainability and ethical impact of a company or investment.

### The Three Pillars:

1. **Environmental (E)** - 40% weight
   - Carbon footprint and emissions
   - Renewable energy usage
   - Waste reduction
   - Environmental compliance

2. **Social (S)** - 30% weight
   - Employee satisfaction
   - Diversity and inclusion
   - Community impact
   - Social responsibility

3. **Governance (G)** - 30% weight
   - Board independence
   - Transparency
   - Ethics and compliance
   - Corporate governance

## What We're Doing in Verdifi Dashboard

The ESG Financial Modeling panel shows how your carbon footprint measurements translate into:

### 1. **ESG Score (0-100)**
   - **What it shows**: Overall ESG performance rating
   - **How it's calculated**: Based on your carbon emissions, energy mix, and simulated social/governance metrics
   - **Why it matters**: Higher scores = better sustainability = better financial performance

### 2. **ESG Premium**
   - **What it shows**: Revenue increase percentage due to good ESG performance
   - **Example**: If you have 70 ESG score, you might get +10.5% revenue premium
   - **Why it matters**: Companies with good ESG often have higher valuations and investor interest

### 3. **Adjusted Return**
   - **What it shows**: Expected return on investment adjusted for ESG risk
   - **Example**: Base return of 8% + ESG bonus = 10.1% adjusted return
   - **Why it matters**: Better ESG reduces investment risk, leading to better returns

### 4. **Enterprise Value**
   - **What it shows**: Estimated company valuation based on ESG-adjusted revenue multiples
   - **Example**: Revenue × Valuation Multiple = Enterprise Value
   - **Why it matters**: Higher ESG = higher valuation multiples = higher company value

### 5. **Environmental/Social/Governance Breakdown**
   - **What it shows**: Individual scores for each ESG pillar (E/S/G)
   - **Example**: E: 32/40, S: 24/30, G: 26/30
   - **Why it matters**: Shows which areas need improvement

### 6. **Carbon Cost Impact**
   - **What it shows**: Financial cost of your carbon emissions
   - **Example**: 100 tons CO2 × $50/ton = $5,000 annual cost
   - **Why it matters**: Carbon pricing shows real financial impact of emissions

### 7. **Potential Savings**
   - **What it shows**: Money you could save by reducing carbon footprint
   - **Example**: 30% reduction potential = $1,500 savings
   - **Why it matters**: Shows ROI of going green

## How It Works in Verdifi

### Real-Time Calculation Flow:

1. **Measure Carbon** → Your server measures carbon emissions in real-time
2. **Calculate ESG** → System calculates ESG score based on:
   - Your actual carbon footprint (Environmental)
   - Simulated social metrics (Social)
   - Simulated governance metrics (Governance)
3. **Financial Impact** → System calculates:
   - How ESG affects revenue (premium)
   - How ESG affects returns (risk adjustment)
   - How ESG affects valuation (enterprise value)
4. **Display Metrics** → Dashboard shows all metrics updating in real-time

## Example Scenario:

**Starting Point:**
- Carbon emissions detected: 400 gCO2e/kWh
- Renewable energy: 60%
- Base revenue: $1,000,000

**ESG Calculation:**
- Environmental Score: 32/40 (good carbon management)
- Social Score: 24/30 (estimated)
- Governance Score: 26/30 (estimated)
- **Overall ESG Score: 82/100**

**Financial Impact:**
- ESG Premium: +12.3% (better ESG = more investor interest)
- Adjusted Revenue: $1,123,000
- Adjusted Return: 10.46% (vs 8% base)
- Enterprise Value: $13.48M (higher valuation multiple)
- Carbon Cost: $5,000/year
- Potential Savings: $1,500/year (if reduce by 30%)
